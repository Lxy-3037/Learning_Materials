Crocodile


1) Behaviors:


      * Constructor: Create an instance of Crocodile at the specified row and column of the grid.
                     It will be have a certain amount of energy and an age 0. It will belong to the "Crocodile" species.
		     It can be identified by a unique name. The maximum energy it can carry must be set to the maximum energy 
                     allowed for a newborn Crocodile. The minimum energy it needs to stay alive must be set to the minimum energy 
                     required for an Crocodile to stay alive. 

      *            liveALittle. Live a block of time. If the Crocodile is hungry then it looks for food in adjacent cell and 
		     moves to that cell to eat if there is Catfish available , otherwise moves to a random adjacent cell.  
		     Relinquish necessary energy to swim and to eat and die if the energy falls bellow the minimum required
                     to stay alive. Increase the minumun and maximum energy of the Crocodile. Returns nothing.

      *	die. Update living status to being dead. Returns nothing. 
      *	isDead. Return the living status of the Crocodile as a boolean. 
      *          getRow. Return the row in which Crocodile is located as an integer. 
      *	getColumn. Return the column in which Crocodile is located as an integer. 
      *          getAge. Return the age of Crocodile as an integer. 	
      *	getName. Return the unique name identifying the Crocodile as a String. 
      *	getImage. Return an image representing the Crocodile. 
      *	getColor. Return the color of the Crocodile as a String. 
      *	getEnergy. Return the current energy level as an integer. 
      *	getDisplayMechanism. Return the mechanism used for displaying the Crocodile, 
                             which is either the name of an image file or a constant defined in the Simulation class. 
      *	getSpecies. Return the species of the Crocodile as a String. 
      *	giveUpEnergy. Relinquish energy when it has eaten for a Crocodile. Returns the energy that it has in that moment. 
      *	getMinEnergy. Return the minimum energy needed to stay alive as an integer. 
      *	getMaxEnergy. Return the maximum energy that can be carried as an integer.   
      *	setEnergy. Set the energy level as specified by the integer value passed as a parameter. 

      *	moveToRow. Move the Crocodile to the row specified by the integer value passed as a parameter. 
                    Returns the row where the Crocodile is moved as an integer. 
      *           moveToColumn. Move the Crocodile to the column specified by the integer value passed as a parameter.
                      Returns the column where the Crocodile is moved as an integer. 
      *	getDirection. Check the direction in which the Crocodile is facing. Returns a String. 
    
      *         lookForFoodInNeighboardhood. Return a neighboring Catfish that is food.

      *	isHungry. Check if the current energy level of the Crocodile is less than twice the amount needed for survival. 
                  Returns a boolean. 
      *        swimIfPossible. Determine whether or not it can move the direction it moves

      *        eatIfPossible.Determine if it can eat food
