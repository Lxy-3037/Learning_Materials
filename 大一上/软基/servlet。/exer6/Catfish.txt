Catfish


1) Behaviors:


      * Constructor: Create an instance of Catfish at the specified row and column of the grid.
                     It will be have a certain amount of energy and an age 0. It will belong to the "Catfish" species.
		     It can be identified by a unique name. The maximum energy it can carry must be set to the maximum energy 
                     allowed for a newborn Catfish. The minimum energy it needs to stay alive must be set to the minimum energy 
                     required for an Catfish to stay alive. 

      *            liveALittle. Live a block of time. If the Catfish is hungry then it looks for food in adjacent cell and 
		     moves to that cell to eat if there is Algae available , otherwise moves to a random adjacent cell.  
		     Relinquish necessary energy to swim and to eat and die if the energy falls bellow the minimum required
                     to stay alive. Increase the minumun and maximum energy of the Catfish. Returns nothing.

      *	die. Update living status to being dead. Returns nothing. 
      *	isDead. Return the living status of the Catfish as a boolean. 
      *          getRow. Return the row in which Catfish is located as an integer. 
      *	getColumn. Return the column in which Catfish is located as an integer. 
      *          getAge. Return the age of Catfish as an integer. 	
      *	getName. Return the unique name identifying the Catfish as a String. 
      *	getImage. Return an image representing the Catfish. 
      *	getColor. Return the color of the Catfish as a String. 
      *	getEnergy. Return the current energy level as an integer. 
      *	getDisplayMechanism. Return the mechanism used for displaying the Catfish, 
                             which is either the name of an image file or a constant defined in the Simulation class. 
      *	getSpecies. Return the species of the Catfish as a String. 
      *	giveUpEnergy. Relinquish energy when it has eaten for a Crocodile. Returns the energy that it has in that moment. 
      *	getMinEnergy. Return the minimum energy needed to stay alive as an integer. 
      *	getMaxEnergy. Return the maximum energy that can be carried as an integer.   
      *	setEnergy. Set the energy level as specified by the integer value passed as a parameter. 

      *	moveToRow. Move the Catfish to the row specified by the integer value passed as a parameter. 
                    Returns the row where the Catfish is moved as an integer. 
      *           moveToColumn. Move the Catfish to the column specified by the integer value passed as a parameter.
                      Returns the column where the Catfish is moved as an integer. 
      *	getDirection. Check the direction in which the Catfish is facing. Returns a String. 
    
      *         lookForFoodInNeighboardhood. Return a neighboring algae that is food.

      *	isHungry. Check if the current energy level of the Catfish is less than twice the amount needed for survival. 
                  Returns a boolean. 
      *        swimIfPossible. Determine whether or not it can move the direction it moves

      *        eatIfPossible.Determine if it can eat food
